HW13: Ex 17.10

17.10. Your company wishes to move from using desktop applications to accessing the same functionality remotely as services. Identify three risks that might arise and suggest how these risks may be reduced.

Although in my opinion the risks of implementing a SaaS (software as a service) are often worth it for non sensitive data driven software there are certain threat potentials described below. 

1. Using a distributed system of services presents the issue of scalabilty, where this did not exist in the monolithic desktop application. It is a blessing and a curse the the software company now has to deal with. 
2. With many different services running in a distrubuted system there is an increased threat potential because each service could be run on different machines and as the number of machines increases so does the attack vector. 
3. The final risk is one of cost. Yes, the potential to save money by scaling to business needs is wonderful and has the potential to change how software works, but at what cost? The cost of maintaining complex service based systems all built out by different teams all reusing code... With complexity comes cost and if the business fails the software fails as well.
