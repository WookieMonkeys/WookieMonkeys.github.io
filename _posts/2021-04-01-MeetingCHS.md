title: Meeting Charleston
---

Hello Internet.
For this blog post, I am going to talk about a meet-up event I went to recently. At the College of Charleston every spring the CS department organizes an Alumni Symposium, where former students give their two senses on their time at school as well as entering the tech work field, their goals for the future, and so on.

The event was broken down into different sections: a general meeting where the 3 alumni panelists gave their brief summaries on how and why they got to where they are now, and then we were separated into breakout rooms to discuss further or ask more personal questions. Although I was very interested in what Megan Gould had to say about how she liked her job as a full-stack engineer because she name-dropped k8s, docker, CI/CD, and being in charge of deploying her code (all things I love about software engineering) I went and talked with Phillip Kramp about his experience at RedHat and possibly getting the school on board with RedHat Academy for a course or something along those lines. Although in reality, my primary motivation was to get formal Ansible training for the cybersecurity club/defense team as we prepare for the next round of competitions.

I think it is fascinating what RedHat has done to the computing industry. Completely looking past the fact they just got acquired by IBM for billions of dollars up until that point they were battling against tech giants like Google and Microsoft pushing them both in their own way towards open source as a viable solution for developing software.

All in all, I felt like I had a good time at the event because of the speakers and the fact they cared enough to come back and talk with the students. However, I would like to take a moment to talk about the shortcoming of events like this at CofC. Yes, it is covid times. Yes, everyone is busy doing work. But no, that doesn't excuse the fact that literally, no underclassmen came to the event. I don't know who to blame honestly. Maybe it is us upperclassmen not taking the time to mentor younger students or is it the CS department administration and our serious lack of motivated professors to share events outside the scope of their class... Seriously I'm willing to bet Dr. Bowring filled more than 75% of that event by making it a homework assignment. But where are the freshman who need to hear about research opportunities in 392 and so on... It is frustrating to see the CS department get worse and worse in terms of motivated students. This only leads professors to just give A's and not care about teaching. It's a cycle.
