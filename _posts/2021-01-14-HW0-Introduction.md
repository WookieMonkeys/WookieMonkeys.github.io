title: Introduction

Yo, my name is Matt. I'm studying Computer Science at the College of Charleston. I also work as a part-time Software Engineer at Decipher Technology Studios in Alexandria, VA. I like music, video games, and making things with my hands.

With the introduction out of the way let's discuss chapter 1 of our textbook Client-Centered Software Development. The first chapter is titled "the journey" as pertaining to the main different stories and unique challenges it takes to develop a software project in the modern world. Some of the topics that I thought were worth me reproducing on this blog in some regard are licensing and development cycles.  

The first topic we will discuss is development life cycles. I think it's important to say that I'm for sure a junior developer. As in my experience planning software project primarily consists of arbitrary school projects and whenever I have tried to implement the agile development method in my own practice it has devolved into a hodgepodge of scrum since no one can be fired from a group project... (I am just as guilty as the next person) That being said I'll take the time to write out the difference between the two most popular development methods I understand them after reading chapter one.
Serial Development vs Agile Development
For serial development, each stage in the process is viewed as a single discrete event. One stage typically does not begin until the previous stage is completed. Typically, the client is involved in the beginning and ending stages, but not in the crucial middle stages.
Whereas agile development, often known as "scrum", "feature-driven development", or "rapid application programming" focuses on achieving an MVP minimal viable product and continually iterates between the stages of: meet, task, design, code, test, review.
In reality, both are viable approaches to planning large complex software issues but I am a strong believer in Agile for tech company-level workloads.

Next, we have the topic of software licensing.
Proprietary Licensing vs Open Source Licensing
Proprietary software is that which is licensed and sold as a binary executable program to individual and corporate customers. The source code is the private property of the developer and is kept hidden from the customer.
Free and open-source software (FOSS) is software whose source code and binary executable code are freely available for download by any individual or organization.
