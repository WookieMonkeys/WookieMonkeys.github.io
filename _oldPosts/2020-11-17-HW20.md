HW20: Blog reflections on team progress.
Since the last deliverable the team has made steady progress mostly in creating more verbose output. We ended up using a custom template.html file and having the HTMLTestRunner consume it. We also passed in our testcase list so that for each entry the requirement and component were also able to be extracted. Along with these editions we made the rest of our 25 test cases. To be honest, I am not satisfied with what we tested and how we went about it. It felts as if we simply tested that software worked properly rather than if it worked. That may just be the nature of testing the front-end side of web applications. I wonder how large corporations test their websitesâ€¦
