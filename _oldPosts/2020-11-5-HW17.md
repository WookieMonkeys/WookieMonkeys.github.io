HW17: Blog reflections on team progress.

Overall, I think our progress on the team project has been steady and meaningful. It was very satisfying to design a testing framework that actually works and might even be a useful template for testing applications in an enterprise system. I haven’t taken a course on python since AP CS in high school is taught in Java, but it has been very nice to work with.  Learning the Selenium package has been a good challenge reading the API docs on how to use it for our needs in this case. I do feel that our group is special in that regard that we aren’t just compiling and running Java or PHP code but are much more hands on how we set up our “testing suite.” We still have progress to be made, mainly in the fields of better output and cleaner test cases. Need to for sure update our readme on directions for running our project.
