HW11: Ex 9.8, 9.10

9.8.  Briefly describe the three main types of software maintenance. Why is it sometimes difficult to distinguish between them? 
1. Fault repairs to fix bugs and vulnerabilities.
	This is the simplest form of software maintenance, fixing things that are broken and updating dependencies. 

2. Environmental Adaptation to adapt to software to new platforms and environments.
	As software becomes more and more complex so does the situations in which it is used. This form of maintained highlights the fact that not all software is suitable for every environment. 

3. Functionality addition to add new features and to support new requirements.
	Maintaining blurs, the lines with developing in this scenario. In order to add new features though, you will undoubtably need to maintain the legacy code to add the new features. 

9.10.  Do software engineers have a professional responsibility to develop code that can be easily maintained even if their employer does not explicitly request it? 
Yes. Personally, I think that is the actual job of a software engineer. Writing code is easy, however putting the effort into making it maintainable is very difficult. We’ve all been there... you are hacking away at a project and you realize you haven’t documented anything. It is the developer’s job/duty in order to be a “professional” to organize their code so that others can inspect it.
