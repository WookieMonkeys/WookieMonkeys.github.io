20.10 You work for a software company that has developed a system that provides information about consumers and that is used within a SoS by a number of other retail businesses. They pay you for the services used. Discuss the ethics of changing the system interfaces without notice to coerce users into paying higher charges. Consider this question from the point of view of the companyâ€™s employees, customers, and shareholders.

At first glance I can see two lines of arguments. The first claiming that this is unethical behavior that should be avoided as a software engineer because it leads to a slippery slope and shady business relations. I beleive the typical software engineer and customer of the software would agree in avoiding this type of behavior. 

Although the question uses words like "without notive" and "coerce" to frame the situation in a negative way from the point of view of a shareholder this may be the optimal path. I think this is a profit driven and short term mindset that is unsustainable as mentioned earlier. 

It is also important to mention that no new features are being added to the software, the interface is just being changed for the sake of making it more complex to use. As an engineer myself I wouldnt want to re-write all of that code.
