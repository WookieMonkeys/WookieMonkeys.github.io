2.1
Suggest the most appropriate generic software process model that might be used as a basis for managing the development of the following systems. Explain your answer according to the type of system being developed:

A system to control antilock braking in a car

* an antilock braking system would be best developed with the Waterfall method because of its requiremtn for safety. Antilock breaks are embedded devices and they literally save lives every day if working as expected and kill people if not. The specifications should be clear from the beginning to enable proper testing of the software. 

A virtual reality system to support software maintenance

* This system would be best developed with the Incremental approach. Since the product will most likely change due to user demands and upgrading with future technology Incremental is the best choice for this system. 

A university accounting system that replaces an existing system

* This system would be best developed with the Integration and Configuration model because it replacing an existing system where possibly old pieces of code can be recyled to reduce cost and complexity. 

An interactive travel planning system that helps users plan journeys with the lowest environmental impact.

* This system would be best developed with the Incremental because it is not mission critical and new iterations of the same software will most likely need to be added on to this due to technological improvements in enviormental impact.
