HW10: Ex 15.10

15.10.  The reuse of software raises a number of copyright and intellectual property issues. If a customer pays a software contractor to develop a system, who has the right to reuse the developed code? Does the software contractor have the right to use that code as a basis for a generic component? What payment mechanisms might be used to reimburse providers of reusable components? Discuss these issues and other ethical issues associated with the reuse of software. 
Indeed. The concept of legal ownership over software is a tricky issue that only gets harder as system of systems become more prevalent in the industry.  In my opinion the answer to the first question of who has the right to reuse the code of a software system is boring. It depends. Mainly on the contract agreed to by both parties that hopefully they got a lawyer to look at. If there is no contract, then I think both parties have the right to reuse the software for any purpose they see fit. 

To answer the second question depends on the route chosen in the first question. If a developer owns the product but rents it out there is no problem. Although the lines maybe blurrier when the developer doesn’t own the code and refactors it to sell in different ways. In the case of simple websites, I don’t see this being an issue, but due to the vast number of genres a software project can take on I don’t think there is a one size fits all. 

If a client purchases the code at a one-time price, I don’t think there is any need to reimburse the provider on reuse. I consider it the same way a wood worker is payed for their labor and the price of the wood. After the final product is given to the customer the wood worker doesn’t own the piece anymore. If they are “an artist” and they rent out their sculpture to a museum, then possibly the wood worker can request they get their sculpture back to add additions to it or make copies of it.
